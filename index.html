        <p>The Modern Gypsies were a few weeks out from our premier on ABCâ€™s Expedition Impossible and we needed
          a website, ASAP.
          Thankfully, worked with us to develop a site before the first episode. Because of his efforts we
          were able to create a
          unique website and connect with our fans.
